<p>The Synth-A-Model project was carried out at the TU Berlin's Audio
Communication Group. The Synth-A-Model compiler was written by Edgar Berdahl,
and the graphical user interface was created by Peter Vasil.  We would like to
graciously thank Prof. Julius O. Smith III, Alexandros Kontogeorgakopoulos,
Prof. Stefan Weinzierl, Prof. Yann Orlarey, and the Alexander von Humboldt
foundation for their support.</p>
