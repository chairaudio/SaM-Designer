These files are just for testing the automatic visualizer -- given an MDL file with no information about where on the page to display the elements, Synth-A-Modeler can try to reorient the model components in a sensible way.

MOST OF THESE MODELS ARE NOT CALIBRATED FOR MAKING AUDIBLE SOUNDS OR FOR FORCE FEEDBACK!



NOTE:  The versions of the Synth-A-Modeler scripts and Makefiles in here are just here for convenience for verifying that the models compile.  They are not the official/final version.
