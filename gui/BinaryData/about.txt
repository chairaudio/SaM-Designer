The Synth-A-Modeler project was carried out at the TU Berlin's Audio Communication Group. The Synth-A-Modeler compiler was written by Edgar Berdahl, and the graphical user interface was created by Peter Vasil. We would like to graciously thank Prof. Julius O. Smith III, Alexandros Kontogeorgakopoulos, Prof. Stefan Weinzierl, Prof. Yann Orlarey, and the Alexander von Humboldt foundation for their support.
